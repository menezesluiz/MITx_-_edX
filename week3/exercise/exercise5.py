"""
Here is a different piece of code for working with lists:
"""
def applyEachTo(L, x):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(L)):
        result.append(L[i](x))
    return result
""" 
Suppose that you are given the following functions:
"""
def square(a):
    return a * a

def halve(a):
    return a / 2

def inc(a):
    return a + 1

"""
For each of the following questions, indicate what value is returned. 
If you believe that an error will occur, write the word 'error'.

# applyEachTo([inc, square, halve, abs], 3.0)
# applyEachTo([inc, max, int], -3)

Exercise 2 part 1
0 points possible (ungraded)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 3 minutes
Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the
Check button.

For each of the expressions below, specify its type and value. If it
generates an error, select type 'NoneType' and write the word 'error'
(note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) in the box for the value.
While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you
to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understand of
basic Python expressions.

Assume we've made the following assignments:

"""

str1 = 'hello'
str2 = ','
str3 = 'world'

str1
print(type(str1))
print(str1)

str1
print(type(str1))
print(str1[0])

str1
print(type(str1))
print(str1[1])

str1
print(type(str1))
print(str1[-1])

str1
print(len(str1))
print(type(len(str1)))

Exercise 3
5/5 points (graded)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes

For each of the following expressions, indicate the value that prints out when 
the expression is evaluated. If the evaluation would lead to an error, write 
the word 'error'; if nothing would print out, write the word 'blank'.

While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you 
to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of 
basic Python expressions.

If the temperatures seem weird to you, like most of the world, you probably 
use the Celsius system. We Americans still use the crazy Fahrenheit system

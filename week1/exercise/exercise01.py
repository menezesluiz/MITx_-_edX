ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes
Note that you will have to answer all questions before you can click the Check
button.

For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the
evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' (note this is a word,
not a string, no quotes). While you could simply type these expressions into
your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help
reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

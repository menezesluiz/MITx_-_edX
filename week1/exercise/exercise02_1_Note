Note: The Python 'in' operator
The operators in and not in test for collection membership (a 'collection'
refers to a string, list, tuple or dictionary - don't worry, we will cover
lists, tuples and dictionaries soon!). The expression

element in coll

evaluates to True if element is a member of the collection coll, and False
otherwise.

The expression

element not in coll

evaluates to True if element is not a member of the collection coll, and
False otherwise.

Note this returns the negation of element in coll - that is, the expression
element not in coll is equivalent to the expression not (element in coll).
